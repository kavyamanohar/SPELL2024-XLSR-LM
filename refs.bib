If they are compared to HMM/DNN systems, which additionally leverage a large corpus of text-only data and expert-crafted lexica, the differences in modeling cannot be disentangled from differences in data. We propose an experimental setup, where only transcribed speech is used to train both model types. To highlight the difference that text-only data can make, we use Finnish, where an expert-crafted lexicon is not needed. With 1500h equal data, we find that both ASR paradigms perform similarly, but adding text data quickly improves the HMM/DNN system. On a smaller 160h subset we find that HMM/DNN models outperform AED models.",

abstract = {We study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results without the need for any dataset specific fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.},
